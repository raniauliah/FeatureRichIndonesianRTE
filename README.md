# Feature Rich Indonesian RTE
This is Python implementation for the work that published on ACLing 2021 with paper entitled, ["Feature-Rich Classifiers for Recognizing Textual Entailment in Indonesian"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921012175). If you find this helpful, please cite to paper. 


Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is a task in Natural Language Processing that can be used to determine the entailment of a sentence from another sentence. In this work we extract 35 features from a pair of text (T) and hypothesis (H) in Indonesian. We aim to solve the RTE task in Indonesian using a feature-rich classifier. 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this paper is **WRETE Dataset** that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/indobenchmark/indonlu/tree/master/dataset/wrete_entailment-ui). 
We only used the train data for the training process and test data to test the model. As explained on the paper, the class distribution in shown below

## Results
After performing an ablation study, the best performance in this work is obtained when using SVM with an F1-Score of 79.65%

## How To Run
1. `IPython Notebook/preprocessing.py` is the code implemented to preprocess both the train and test data. 
2. `IPython Notebook/model_processing.py` is the code implemented to train the model using all extracted data in the preprocessing step. The testing scenario also implemented in this code.
